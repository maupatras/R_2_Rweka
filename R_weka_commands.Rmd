```{r , echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
require(RWeka)
## Use some example data.
w <- read.arff(system.file("arff","weather.nominal.arff",
package = "RWeka"))

## Identify a decision tree.
m <- J48(play~., data = w)

```

The details of the decision tree and the evaluation of 10-cross validation can also be implemented through the following segment:
```{r}
m

## Use 10 fold cross-validation.
e <- evaluate_Weka_classifier(m, cost = matrix(c(0,2,1,0), ncol = 2),
						numFolds = 10, complexity = TRUE,
						seed = 123, class = TRUE)

e

summary(e)

e$details

```

If we want to see the play distibution by level in play, we can make it by a stacked bar plot.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
require(ggplot2)
ggplot(w, aes(x= windy, fill = play )) + geom_bar(position = "dodge")
```
